== Description ==
Automatically Link images to none in selecting and uploading images in Wordpress !

By default, WordPress links images to themselves.
A user sees that the image is a link, clicks it and they are then taken to the image file. From this page the user has two options: click the "back" button in their browser or move on to another site. Usually it is the latter. It also affects your image SEO traffic because search engines could redirect users to the link used for the image instead of your post. 
Overall, it creates bad user experience and affects your site's bounce rate.

Solution is that you simply install this plugin and set link to none by default in wordpress. 

Please feel free to offer any feature suggestions you might have and I will consider them for future releases.
